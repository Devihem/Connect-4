📑 **About:**

*‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ This is a basic project in python, that recreates the game Connect 4. The project is created as training project in my advanced python course in SoftUni. I go forward from the basic version and try to add more life to it, as adding good visualization in terminal and add more options as different game-play modes for more players at once and  to be more competitive and interesting option to play versus AI-Player ( Simple Monte Carlo  - model ).* 

‎ ‎

⭐‎**Additional costumizations :**

- Versus AI ( Human vs AI )
- Normal ( for quick games of 2 players )
- Party Up to 6 players on Custom Board
- Players have personal color
- Have option for replay.

‎ ‎

⚙️ **Game - Begining and Rules :**

- Players must connect 4 of the same colored discs in a row to win. 
- Only one piece is played at a time.
- The game ends when there is a 4-in-a-row or a stalemate.
- The starter of the previous game goes second on the next game.
